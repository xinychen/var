The scientific question is how to **discover dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data**. We utilize the Vector Autoregression (VAR) as a basic tool to explore the spatiotemporal data in real-world applications.

## Data Sets

### Fluid Dynamics

To analyze the underlying spatiotemporal patterns of fluid dynamics, we consider the cylinder wake dataset in which the flow shows a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. [The cylinder wake dataset](http://dmdbook.com/) is collected from the fluid flow passing a circular cylinder with laminar vortex shedding at Reynolds number Re = 100, which is larger than the critical Reynolds number, using direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a representative three-dimensional flow dataset in fluid dynamics, consisting of matrix-variate time series of vorticity field snapshots for the wake behind a cylinder. The dataset is of size $199\times 449\times 150$, representing 199-by-449 vorticity fields with 150 time snapshots.
