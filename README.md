The scientific question is how to **discover dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data**. We utilize the Vector Autoregression (VAR) as a basic tool to explore the spatiotemporal data in real-world applications.

## Datasets

### Fluid Dynamics

To analyze the underlying spatiotemporal patterns of fluid dynamics, we consider the cylinder wake dataset in which the flow shows a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. [The cylinder wake dataset](http://dmdbook.com/) is collected from the fluid flow passing a circular cylinder with laminar vortex shedding at Reynolds number Re = 100, which is larger than the critical Reynolds number, using direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a representative three-dimensional flow dataset in fluid dynamics, consisting of matrix-variate time series of vorticity field snapshots for the wake behind a cylinder. The dataset is of size $199\times 449\times 150$, representing 199-by-449 vorticity fields with 150 time snapshots.

### Sea Surface Temperature

[The sea surface temperature dataset](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html) covers weekly means of temperature on the spatial resolution of (1 degree latitude, 1 degree longitude)-grid, and there are $180\times 360$ global grids (i.e., 64,800 grids) in total. The dataset spans a 30-year period from 1990 to 2019, and the time dimension is of length 1,565 (weeks). Therefore, the data can be represented as a matrix of size $64800\times 1565$, which seems to be high-dimensional.

### USA Surface Temperature Data

[Daymet project](https://daac.ornl.gov/DAYMET) provides long-term and continuous estimates of daily weather parameters such as maximum and minimum daily temperature for North America. There are 5,380 stations over the United States Mainland. We use the daily maximum temperature data in the United States Mainland from 2010 to 2021 (i.e., 12 years or 4,380 days in total) for evaluation. The data can be represented as a matrix of size $5380\times 4380$.

### NYC Taxi Trips

We consider to use an [NYC (yellow) taxi trip dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). We use 69 zones in Manhattan as pickup/dropoff zones and aggregate daily taxi trip volume of the data from 2012 to 2021. Therefore, the daily trip volume tensor is of size $69\times 69\times 3653$.
